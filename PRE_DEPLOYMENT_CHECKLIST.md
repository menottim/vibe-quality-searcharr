# Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

**Before deploying Vibe-Quality-Searcharr to production, complete all items on this checklist.**

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Use

### 1. Update Dependencies (Fix Known CVEs)

**Status:** [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] ✅ Complete

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Stop container
docker-compose down

# Ensure you have the latest code
git pull  # or download latest release

# Rebuild with latest dependencies
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Restart
docker-compose up -d
```

**What This Fixes:**
- CVE-2025-62727: Starlette DoS via Range header
- CVE-2025-54121: Starlette DoS via multipart

**Verification:**
```bash
docker-compose exec vibe-quality-searcharr pip show starlette | grep Version
# Should show: Version: 0.49.1 or higher
```

---

### 2. Generate Strong Secret Keys

**Status:** [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] ✅ Complete

**Action Required:**

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Create secrets directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path secrets

# Generate 3 random keys (copy entire block)
$dbKey = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) + (33,35,36,37,38,42,45,46,61,63,64,95) | Get-Random -Count 64 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
$dbKey | Out-File -FilePath "secrets\db_key.txt" -NoNewline -Encoding ASCII

$secretKey = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) + (33,35,36,37,38,42,45,46,61,63,64,95) | Get-Random -Count 64 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
$secretKey | Out-File -FilePath "secrets\secret_key.txt" -NoNewline -Encoding ASCII

$pepper = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) + (33,35,36,37,38,42,45,46,61,63,64,95) | Get-Random -Count 64 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
$pepper | Out-File -FilePath "secrets\pepper.txt" -NoNewline -Encoding ASCII

Write-Host "✅ Security keys generated!"
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check files exist and contain data
ls -lh secrets/
# All 3 files should be ~64 bytes each
```

**⚠️ BACKUP THESE FILES SECURELY!** Store copies in:
- Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
- Encrypted USB drive
- Secure cloud storage (encrypted)

**If you lose these files, you cannot decrypt your database!**

---

### 3. Configure Production Environment

**Status:** [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] ✅ Complete

**Action Required:**

Create `.env` file in project root:

```bash
# Production Settings (REQUIRED)
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Security Settings (REQUIRED)
SECURE_COOKIES=true
ALLOW_LOCAL_INSTANCES=false

# Worker Configuration (REQUIRED)
WORKERS=1

# Secrets (REQUIRED - using Docker secrets)
SECRET_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/secret_key
PEPPER_FILE=/run/secrets/pepper
DATABASE_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/db_key

# Optional: Customize these if needed
# HOST=0.0.0.0
# PORT=7337
# LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# After restart, check environment
docker-compose exec vibe-quality-searcharr env | grep -E "(ENVIRONMENT|SECURE_COOKIES|WORKERS)"
```

Should show:
- `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- `SECURE_COOKIES=true`
- `WORKERS=1`

---

### 4. Enable HTTPS/TLS

**Status:** [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] ✅ Complete

**⚠️ DO NOT skip this step for production deployments!**

**Choose One Option:**

#### Option A: Nginx Reverse Proxy (Recommended)

1. Install nginx: `sudo apt-get install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx`
2. Get SSL certificate: `sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com`
3. Configure nginx (see [deploy-with-docker.md](docs/how-to-guides/deploy-with-docker.md#c-enable-httpstls-required-for-production))
4. Test HTTPS: `curl -I https://your-domain.com`

#### Option B: Traefik (Docker-native)

1. Add Traefik service to docker-compose.yml
2. Configure Let's Encrypt (see docs)
3. Add labels to vibe-quality-searcharr service
4. Restart: `docker-compose up -d`

#### Option C: Cloudflare Tunnel (Easy for Windows)

1. Sign up: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Download cloudflared
3. Run: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:7337`
4. Access via provided HTTPS URL

**Verification:**
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com | grep -E "(HTTP|Strict-Transport-Security)"
```

Should see:
- `HTTP/2 200` or `HTTP/1.1 200`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`

# 3. Check secrets are loaded
docker-compose exec vibe-quality-searcharr env | grep -E "(SECRET_KEY_FILE|PEPPER_FILE|DATABASE_KEY_FILE)"
# Expected: All 3 variables should show /run/secrets/... paths

# 4. Check worker count
docker-compose exec vibe-quality-searcharr env | grep WORKERS
# Expected: WORKERS=1

# 5. Test HTTPS (if configured)

# Expected: HTTP 200 + Strict-Transport-Security header

# 6. Test rate limiting (should see 429 after 5 attempts)

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"wrong"}'; done
# Expected: First 5 attempts return 401, 6th returns 429 (rate limited)
