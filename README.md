# Vibe-Quality-Searcharr

**Version 1.0.0** | Intelligent backlog search automation for Sonarr and Radarr.

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: AI-Generated Code Warning**

**This entire project was 100% "vibe coded" using AI assistance (Claude Code).** While implementing OWASP Top 10 2025 and NIST security guidelines, this codebase is **NOT production-ready, NOT security-reviewed, and NOT battle-tested**. AI-generated code may contain subtle security flaws, logic errors, cryptographic misuse, race conditions, and authentication bypasses that appear correct but are fundamentally broken.

**Use at your own risk.** Before deploying: conduct a professional security audit, perform penetration testing, review all cryptographic implementations, run static analysis tools (Bandit, Semgrep), deploy in isolated environments with aggressive monitoring, and maintain regular backups. This codebase is intended for **educational purposes only** - learning about Python security patterns, FastAPI architecture, and OWASP mitigation strategies. Do not use for production deployments, sensitive data, critical infrastructure, or internet-accessible services without extensive professional review.

### About the Author & Security Approach

I am a **Security Engineering professional** with expertise in infrastructure security and privacy engineering. At this stage of my career, I spend most of my time leading teams rather than writing code. While I have a solid understanding of software development practices and security principles, I am **not an expert Security Software Engineer**. Secure software development at scale requires specialized expertise that differs from infrastructure security and engineering leadership.

**Security Implementation Approach:**

During this vibe-coding exercise, I made every effort to implement security best practices by drawing on my professional knowledge and industry best practices. However, there is a **significant difference** between understanding security principles and correctly implementing them in production code. Subtle implementation flaws—such as improper error handling that leaks information, race conditions in authentication flows, or cryptographic API misuse—can undermine even well-intentioned security measures.

**The combination of:**
1. AI-generated code (which may have subtle flaws despite appearing correct)
2. Implementation by a security professional rather than a specialized secure development expert
3. Lack of professional security code review

**...means this codebase should be treated as an educational exercise, not production software.**

## Overview

Vibe-Quality-Searcharr automates systematic backlog searching for missing and upgradeable media in your Sonarr and Radarr instances. It intelligently orchestrates searches over time, respecting API rate limits while maximizing coverage.

### Key Features

- 🔍 **Intelligent Search Scheduling** - Multiple strategies: round-robin, priority-based, aging-based
- 🔒 **Security First** - OWASP Top 10 2025 compliant, encrypted credentials, comprehensive audit logging
- 📊 **Search History Tracking** - Never search the same item twice unnecessarily
- ⚡ **Rate Limit Aware** - Respects indexer API limits to prevent bans
- 🎯 **Multi-Instance Support** - Manage multiple Sonarr/Radarr instances from one interface
- 🔐 **Local Authentication** - Secure password storage with Argon2id hashing
- 📈 **Configuration Drift Detection** - Alerts when Sonarr/Radarr config changes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Docker (recommended) or Poetry for local development

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibe-quality-searcharr.git
cd vibe-quality-searcharr

# 2. Generate secrets
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh

# 3. Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Access web interface
# Open http://localhost:7337/setup
```

See [Deploy with Docker](docs/how-to-guides/deploy-with-docker.md) for complete instructions.

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with development configuration
   ```

3. **Initialize database:**
   ```bash
   poetry run alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   poetry run uvicorn src.vibe_quality_searcharr.main:app --reload
   ```

## Security

⚠️ **REMINDER: This is AI-generated code. See disclaimer above.**

Vibe-Quality-Searcharr **attempts to implement** defense-in-depth security features:

- ✅ Argon2id password hashing with 128 MiB memory *(implementation requires audit)*
- ✅ AES-256 database encryption via SQLCipher *(implementation requires audit)*
- ✅ API keys encrypted at rest with pepper stored separately *(implementation requires audit)*
- ✅ HTTP-only, secure, same-site cookies *(implementation requires audit)*
- ✅ JWT token rotation *(implementation requires audit)*
- ✅ Rate limiting on all authentication endpoints *(implementation requires audit)*
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation *(edge cases may exist)*
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries *(usage requires verification)*
- ✅ Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) *(configuration requires review)*
- ✅ Non-root Docker container with read-only filesystem *(container security requires audit)*

These features are **implemented as specified** but have **NOT been security audited**. The implementation may contain critical vulnerabilities despite following best practice specifications.

See [SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md](SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for intended security design.
