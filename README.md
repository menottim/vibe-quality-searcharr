<p align="center"><strong><a href="https://github.com/menottim/splintarr/releases/tag/v1.3.0">Version 1.3.0</a></strong> | Automated backlog search for Sonarr, designed for homelab use.</p>

> **Status: v1.3.0 -- Polish & Reach**
>
> Splintarr is ready for use by homelab enthusiasts. Tested on Docker Desktop for Windows; Linux and macOS Docker environments are expected to work but have not been independently verified. **Radarr support is planned for a future release; currently supports Sonarr only.** This is AI-generated code (Claude Code) — treat accordingly.

## Overview

Splintarr automates systematic backlog searching for missing and upgradeable media in your Sonarr instances (Radarr support coming in a future release). It runs as a Docker container on your home network and intelligently schedules searches over time, respecting API rate limits while maximizing coverage.

### Who This Is For

This tool is designed for **homelab enthusiasts** running personal Sonarr instances who want to automate search optimization in their home environment.

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Search Scheduling** -- Multiple strategies with interval, daily, and weekly modes plus jitter
- **Custom Strategy Filters** -- Target searches by year range, quality profile, and series status with combined Missing + Cutoff Unmet
- **Search Intelligence** -- Adaptive prioritization, per-episode cooldowns, and search result feedback
- **Real-Time WebSocket Updates** -- Single connection replaces polling, with auto-reconnect and fallback
- **Live Search Progress** -- Progress bar and streaming results on queue detail, running indicator on dashboard
- **Dry Run / Preview Mode** -- See what would be searched before running, with scores and reasons
- **Search Analytics** -- Last 7 days dashboard card with trends and top searched series
- **Bulk Queue Operations** -- Multi-select with bulk pause, resume, run, and delete
- **Demo Mode** -- Synthetic data on new installs so the dashboard looks alive before setup
- **Season Pack Detection** -- Automatically searches for season packs with individual episode fallback
- **Prowlarr Integration** -- Indexer-aware rate limiting with budget progress bars and alerts
- **Series Completion Cards** -- Visual completion progress on dashboard and Library page
- **Config Import/Export** -- Backup and restore your configuration with encrypted API key re-entry
- **Library Overview** -- Visual poster grid with episode-level completion tracking
- **Content Exclusion Lists** -- Exclude specific titles from automated searches
- **Discord Notifications** -- Alerts for search activity, instance health, and queue events
- **Multi-Instance Support** -- Manage multiple Sonarr instances from one interface
- **Automatic Update Checker** -- Checks GitHub for new releases daily, dismissible dashboard banner
- **Encrypted Database** -- AES-256 encryption via SQLCipher with Fernet-encrypted API keys

## Quick Start

### Windows

See the **[Windows Quick Start Guide](docs/how-to-guides/windows-quick-start.md)** for step-by-step instructions.

### Linux / macOS

See the **[Docker Deployment Guide](docs/how-to-guides/deploy-with-docker.md)** for complete instructions.

**Short version:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/menottim/splintarr.git
cd splintarr
./scripts/setup.sh --auto-start
```

Then open **http://localhost:7337** to complete the setup wizard.

After installation, see the **[Getting Started Tutorial](docs/tutorials/getting-started.md)** for a walkthrough of the setup wizard, dashboard, and creating your first search queue.

## Architecture Overview

Splintarr is built with:

- **FastAPI** -- Async web framework serving the UI and REST API
- **SQLAlchemy + SQLCipher** -- ORM with encrypted database storage
- **APScheduler** -- Background job scheduling for search queues
- **httpx** -- Async HTTP client for communicating with Sonarr APIs (Radarr planned)
- **Argon2id** -- Password hashing
- **Pydantic** -- Input validation and configuration management

The application runs as a single Docker container with a SQLite/SQLCipher database stored in a mounted volume. See **[Architecture](docs/explanation/architecture.md)** for the full design.

### AI-Generated Code Warning

**This project was 100% "vibe coded" using AI assistance (Claude Code).** This codebase is **NOT production-ready, NOT security-reviewed, and NOT battle-tested**. AI-generated code may contain security flaws, logic errors, and bugs that appear correct but are fundamentally broken.

**Use at your own risk.** This is an **educational project for homelab tinkering only**. Do not expose this application to the internet without extensive professional security review and testing.

### About the Author and Security Approach

I am a **Security Engineering professional** with expertise in infrastructure security and privacy engineering. At this stage of my career, I spend most of my time leading teams rather than writing code. While I have a solid understanding of software development practices and security principles, I am **not an expert Security Software Engineer**.

During this vibe-coding exercise, I made every effort to implement security best practices by drawing on my professional knowledge. However, there is a **significant difference** between understanding security principles and correctly implementing them in code. The combination of AI-generated code, implementation by a security professional rather than a specialized secure development expert, and lack of professional security code review means this codebase should be treated as an educational exercise, not production software.
