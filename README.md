## AI-Generated Code Warning

**This project was 100% "vibe coded" using AI assistance (Claude Code).** This codebase is **NOT production-ready, NOT security-reviewed, and NOT battle-tested**. AI-generated code may contain security flaws, logic errors, and bugs that appear correct but are fundamentally broken.

**Use at your own risk.** This is an **educational project for homelab tinkering only**. Do not expose this application to the internet without extensive professional security review and testing.

### About the Author and Security Approach

I am a **Security Engineering professional** with expertise in infrastructure security and privacy engineering. At this stage of my career, I spend most of my time leading teams rather than writing code. While I have a solid understanding of software development practices and security principles, I am **not an expert Security Software Engineer**.

During this vibe-coding exercise, I made every effort to implement security best practices by drawing on my professional knowledge. However, there is a **significant difference** between understanding security principles and correctly implementing them in code. The combination of AI-generated code, implementation by a security professional rather than a specialized secure development expert, and lack of professional security code review means this codebase should be treated as an educational exercise, not production software.

## Overview

Splintarr automates systematic backlog searching for missing and upgradeable media in your Sonarr and Radarr instances. It runs as a Docker container on your home network and intelligently schedules searches over time, respecting API rate limits while maximizing coverage.

### Who This Is For

This tool is designed for **homelab enthusiasts** running personal Sonarr and Radarr instances who want to automate search optimization in their home environment.

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Search Scheduling** -- Multiple strategies including round-robin, priority-based, and aging-based
- **Search History Tracking** -- Avoids searching the same item twice unnecessarily
- **Rate Limit Aware** -- Respects indexer API limits to prevent bans
- **Multi-Instance Support** -- Manage multiple Sonarr and Radarr instances from one interface
- **Local Authentication** -- Secure password storage with Argon2id hashing
- **Configuration Drift Detection** -- Alerts when Sonarr or Radarr configuration changes
- **Encrypted Database** -- AES-256 encryption via SQLCipher

## Quick Start

### Windows

See the **[Windows Quick Start Guide](docs/how-to-guides/windows-quick-start.md)** for step-by-step instructions.

### Linux / macOS

See the **[Docker Deployment Guide](docs/how-to-guides/deploy-with-docker.md)** for complete instructions.

**Short version:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/menottim/splintarr.git
cd splintarr
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Then open **http://localhost:7337/setup** to complete the setup wizard.

After installation, see the **[Getting Started Tutorial](docs/tutorials/getting-started.md)** for a walkthrough of the setup wizard, dashboard, and creating your first search queue.

## Architecture Overview

Splintarr is built with:

- **FastAPI** -- Async web framework serving the UI and REST API
- **SQLAlchemy + SQLCipher** -- ORM with encrypted database storage
- **APScheduler** -- Background job scheduling for search queues
- **httpx** -- Async HTTP client for communicating with Sonarr and Radarr APIs
- **Argon2id** -- Password hashing
- **Pydantic** -- Input validation and configuration management

The application runs as a single Docker container with a SQLite/SQLCipher database stored in a mounted volume. See **[Architecture](docs/explanation/architecture.md)** for the full design.
