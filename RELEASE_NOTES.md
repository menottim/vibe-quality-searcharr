# Release Notes

## Version 0.1.0-alpha - Initial Alpha Release

**Release Date:** February 24, 2026

**⚠️ ALPHA RELEASE - NOT HAND-VERIFIED FOR DEPLOYMENT**

---

## 🎉 Overview

This is the **initial alpha release** of **Vibe-Quality-Searcharr**. This release includes all core features and comprehensive security fixes, but **has not been hand-verified for deployment**.

**Use with caution:** This is intended for homelab enthusiasts and early testers only. Full production deployment testing and verification will come in a future stable release (v1.0.0).

Vibe-Quality-Searcharr automates backlog searching for Sonarr and Radarr, intelligently scheduling searches while respecting API rate limits. This alpha release has undergone comprehensive security review and fixes, but real-world deployment scenarios have not been manually tested.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### AI-Generated Code Warning

**This entire codebase is 100% AI-generated using Claude Code.**

While implementing OWASP Top 10 2025 and NIST security guidelines, this codebase is:
- ❌ **NOT professionally security-audited**
- ❌ **NOT battle-tested in production**
- ❌ **NOT warranted for any purpose**

AI-generated code may contain:
- Subtle security flaws
- Logic errors
- Cryptographic misuse
- Race conditions
- Authentication bypasses
- Other vulnerabilities that appear correct but are fundamentally broken

### Use at Your Own Risk

**This software is provided for educational purposes.**

Before deploying:
- ✅ Conduct professional security audit
- ✅ Perform penetration testing
- ✅ Review all cryptographic implementations
- ✅ Run static analysis tools (Bandit, Semgrep)
- ✅ Deploy in isolated environments
- ✅ Implement aggressive monitoring
- ✅ Maintain regular backups

**Do NOT use for:**
- Production deployments without security review
- Sensitive data
- Critical infrastructure
- Internet-accessible services without extensive professional review

### Security Vulnerability Reporting

**Public disclosure is welcome.** Since this is clearly marked as requiring security review:
- ✅ Open GitHub issues for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Submit pull requests with fixes
- ✅ No embargo needed - users are warned

Your findings help improve the codebase and demonstrate where AI code generation falls short!
