## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Docker

**Already have Docker?** Skip to Step 2.

```bash
# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# Verify
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

For other operating systems, see [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Step 2: Download Vibe-Quality-Searcharr

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibe-quality-searcharr.git
cd vibe-quality-searcharr

# Or download and extract
wget https://github.com/yourusername/vibe-quality-searcharr/archive/v1.0.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf v1.0.0.tar.gz
cd vibe-quality-searcharr-1.0.0
```

### Step 3: Generate Security Secrets

```bash
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh

- Multiple Radarr instances (e.g., Movies4K, Movies1080p)
- Mix of both

Each instance can have its own search queue with different strategies and schedules.

---

## Creating Search Queues

### Search Queue Options

**Name:** Descriptive name (e.g., "Weekly 4K Upgrades")

**Instance:** Select which Sonarr/Radarr instance

**Strategy:**
- **Missing** - Search all content marked as missing
- **Cutoff Unmet** - Search content below quality cutoff
- **Recent** - Only search recently added content
- **Custom** - Advanced: filter by tags, quality, etc.

**Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression** - For advanced scheduling
  - Daily at 2 AM: `0 2 * * *`
  - Every 6 hours: `0 */6 * * *`
  - Weekdays at noon: `0 12 * * 1-5`
- **Or use presets** - Daily, weekly, etc.

**Items per Batch:**
- How many items to search in one run
- Higher = faster, more API load
- Recommended: 20-50

**Enabled:**
- Check to start immediately
- Uncheck to create but not start

### Example Queues

**Daily Missing Search:**
```
Name: Daily Missing
Strategy: Missing
Schedule: 0 2 * * * (2 AM daily)
Batch Size: 50
```

**Weekly Quality Upgrade:**
```
Name: Weekend Upgrades
Strategy: Cutoff Unmet
Schedule: 0 2 * * 6 (Saturday 2 AM)
Batch Size: 30
```

**Continuous Recent:**
```
Name: Recent Additions
Strategy: Recent (last 30 days)
Schedule: 0 */6 * * * (Every 6 hours)
Batch Size: 20
```

## Understanding Search History

### What Gets Tracked

Every search operation is logged with:
- Date and time
- Instance name
- Search strategy used
- Item searched (episode/movie)
- Result (success/failure)
- Downloads found

### Cooldown Period

**24-hour cooldown:** Once an item is searched, it won't be searched again for 24 hours.

**Why?** Prevents overwhelming your indexers with duplicate searches.

**Override:** You can manually trigger immediate search from instance management.

### Viewing History

1. Go to "Search History"
2. Filter by:
   - Date range
   - Instance
   - Success/failure
   - Search strategy

---

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication (Recommended)

### Setup 2FA

1. Go to "Settings" → "Security"
2. Click "Enable 2FA"
3. Scan QR code with authenticator app:
   - Google Authenticator
   - Authy
   - 1Password
   - Bitwarden
4. Enter 6-digit code to verify
5. **Save backup codes** in secure location

### Using 2FA

After setup, you'll be prompted for a 6-digit code after entering your password.

**Lost device?** Use backup codes to regain access.

---

## Configuration Tips

### For Best Performance

1. **Stagger search schedules** across instances
   - Instance 1: 2 AM
   - Instance 2: 3 AM
   - Instance 3: 4 AM

2. **Adjust batch sizes** based on your indexers
   - More indexers = higher batch size
   - Fewer indexers = lower batch size

3. **Use different strategies** for different needs
   - Missing: Daily
   - Cutoff Unmet: Weekly
   - Recent: Every 6 hours

### Resource Management

**Memory usage:**
- Light usage (<5 instances): 256-512 MB
- Medium usage (5-15 instances): 512 MB-1 GB
- Heavy usage (15+ instances): 1-2 GB

Adjust in `docker-compose.yml` if needed.

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Can't Connect to Instance

**Check:**
1. URL is correct (include http:// or https://)
2. Port is included (e.g., :8989)
3. API key is correct
4. Instance is running and accessible
5. Firewall allows connection

**Test from Docker container:**
```bash
docker exec vibe-quality-searcharr curl -v http://your-sonarr:8989/api/v3/system/status?apikey=YOUR_KEY
```

### Searches Not Running

**Check:**
1. Queue is enabled (green toggle)
2. Schedule is correct
3. Instance is connected
4. Check Search History for errors

### Forgot Password

**Reset via Docker:**
```bash
# Access container
docker exec -it vibe-quality-searcharr sh

# Reset password (future feature)
# For now, restore from backup or recreate
```

### Application Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs

# Common fixes:
# 1. Port conflict
sudo lsof -i :7337

# 2. Permission issues
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 data/

# 3. Secrets missing
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh
```
