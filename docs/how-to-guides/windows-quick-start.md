# Windows Quick Start Guide

**Complete step-by-step guide for Windows users new to Docker**

This guide assumes you have **no Docker experience** and will walk you through every step needed to run Vibe-Quality-Searcharr on Windows.

---

## ⚠️ Important: Windows Security Notice

**On Windows, this application runs with elevated privileges inside the Docker container.**

**What this means:**
- The application runs as the `root` user **inside the container** (not on your Windows system)
- This is necessary due to how Windows handles Docker volume permissions
- Your Windows system remains protected - the container is isolated

**Why is this required on Windows?**
Windows and Linux handle file permissions differently. When Docker mounts a Windows directory into a Linux container, the permission system doesn't translate properly. Running as root inside the container is the pragmatic solution that ensures the application can write to its database.

**Security implications:**
- ✅ **Your Windows system is safe**: The container is sandboxed and isolated from your Windows installation
- ✅ **On Linux, runs as non-root**: If you deploy on a Linux server, the application automatically runs as a non-root user
- ⚠️ **Container compromise**: If the application inside the container were compromised, the attacker would have root privileges *within that container* (but not on your Windows system)
- ℹ️ **Standard trade-off**: This is a common compromise for Docker applications on Windows in home/development environments

**For production use:** If deploying on a Linux server, the application will automatically detect that it can run as a non-root user and do so. The root fallback only activates on Windows.

**Bottom line:** For home use on Windows, this is an acceptable trade-off. The application works reliably, and your Windows system remains protected by Docker's container isolation.

## Automated Setup

**The easy way:** Run our automated setup script that does everything for you!

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project Folder

1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Navigate to where you extracted/cloned the project
3. **Right-click in the folder** (not on a file)
4. Select **"Open in Terminal"** or **"Open PowerShell window here"**
   - If you don't see this option, open PowerShell and use `cd` to navigate:
     ```powershell
     cd "C:\Users\YourName\vibe-quality-searcharr"
     ```

### Step 2: Allow PowerShell Scripts (One-Time Setup)

```powershell
# Allow scripts to run (one-time setup)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

**Option A: Complete Automated Setup (Recommended)**

This builds and starts everything automatically:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -AutoStart
```

**Option B: Setup Only (Manual Start)**

This prepares everything but lets you start manually:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-windows.ps1
```

**What the setup script does:**
- ✅ Checks Docker and Docker Compose are installed
- ✅ Verifies Docker is running
- ✅ Creates the `data` directory for your database
- ✅ Creates the `secrets` directory
- ✅ Generates 3 cryptographically secure encryption keys
- ✅ Validates all keys were created correctly
- ✅ Sets secure file permissions
- ✅ (With `-AutoStart`) Builds the Docker image
- ✅ (With `-AutoStart`) Starts the application

**What you'll see:**

```

================================================================
Setup Complete!
================================================================

Next Steps:

  1. Check the application logs:
     docker-compose logs -f

  2. Open your browser to:
     http://localhost:7337

  3. Follow the setup wizard to create your admin account
```

### Step 4: Verify It's Running

```powershell
docker-compose ps
```

You should see:
```
NAME                      STATUS          PORTS
vibe-quality-searcharr    Up 30 seconds   127.0.0.1:7337->7337/tcp
```

The `STATUS` should say "Up" (not "Exited" or "Restarting").

**Check the logs:**
```powershell
# View recent logs
docker-compose logs --tail=50

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f
```

**You should see:**
```
INFO - Application starting
INFO - Database connection established
INFO - Scheduler initialized
INFO - Server started at http://0.0.0.0:7337
```

**Log files are located at:**
- `logs/all.log` - All messages
- `logs/error.log` - Errors only
- `logs/debug.log` - Debug info (when DEBUG mode enabled)

Logs automatically rotate when they reach 10MB (5 backups kept).

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Backup Your Encryption Keys!**

The setup script created encryption keys in the `secrets/` folder. If you lose these, you cannot decrypt your data!

```powershell
# View your secret files
Get-ChildItem -Path secrets
```

You should see:
- `db_key.txt`
- `secret_key.txt`
- `pepper.txt`

**Copy these to a secure location:**
- Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
- Encrypted USB drive
- Secure cloud storage (encrypted)

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run commands individually or the automated script fails:

### Generate Security Keys Manually

```powershell
# Run the key generation script
.\scripts\generate-secrets.ps1
```

### Build and Start Manually

```powershell
# Create data directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .\data

# Build the Docker image
docker-compose build

# Start the container
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running
docker-compose ps
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "docker: command not found"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running (check system tray for whale icon)
2. Restart PowerShell
3. If still failing, reinstall Docker Desktop

### Problem: "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"

**Solution:**
1. Open Docker Desktop from Start Menu
2. Wait for it to fully start (whale icon stops animating)
3. Try the command again

### Problem: "Port 7337 is already in use"

**Solution:**
1. Another program is using port 7337
2. Stop the other program, OR
3. Change the port in `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "127.0.0.1:8080:7337"  # Change 7337 to 8080 (or any available port)
   ```
4. Access at `http://localhost:8080` instead

### Problem: "no configuration file provided: not found"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're in the correct directory:
   ```powershell
   pwd  # Shows current directory
   ```
2. The directory should contain `docker-compose.yml`
3. If not, navigate to the correct directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\YourName\vibe-quality-searcharr"
   ```

### Problem: Container keeps restarting

**Solution:**
1. Check the logs:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose logs --tail=100
   ```
2. Look for errors (usually missing secret files or configuration issues)
3. Common fixes:
   - Regenerate secret files: `.\scripts\generate-secrets.ps1`
   - Ensure data directory exists: `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .\data`
   - Ensure logs directory exists: `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .\logs`
   - Check Docker Desktop has enough memory (Settings → Resources → Increase memory to 4GB+)

**Enable debug logging for more details:**
```powershell
# Edit docker-compose.yml or create .env file:
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

Then restart:
```powershell
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Problem: "unable to open database file" error

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: (sqlcipher3.dbapi2.OperationalError) unable to open database file
RuntimeError: Failed to initialize database
```

**This issue has been FIXED** in the current version. The fix includes:
- Custom SQLCipher connection creator that sets encryption immediately
- Proper pragma key configuration before any database operations
- Windows-compatible volume permission handling

**If you still see this error:**
1. Make sure you're using the latest version
2. Stop the container:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose down
   ```
3. Ensure the data directory exists:
   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .\data
   ```
4. Verify Docker has write permissions (Settings → Resources → File Sharing → Add your project directory)
5. Rebuild and restart:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
6. If still failing, try running the automated setup script again:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -AutoStart
   ```

**Check logs for details:**
```powershell
docker-compose logs --tail=50
```

### Problem: "WSL 2 installation is incomplete"

**Solution:**
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
3. Restart your computer
4. Try starting Docker Desktop again

### Problem: Application is slow

**Solution:**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to Settings → Resources
3. Increase:
   - **CPUs:** At least 2
   - **Memory:** At least 4GB
4. Click **"Apply & Restart"**

3. Create a new issue with:
   - Your Windows version
   - Docker Desktop version
   - Full error message
   - Steps you've tried

**Remember:** Include logs but **NEVER** share your secret keys!

```powershell
# Get logs (safe to share)
docker-compose logs > logs.txt
```

---

## Post-Deployment: Critical Security Steps

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Before using the application, complete these security hardening steps!

### Step 1: Update Dependencies (Fix Known CVEs)

Some dependencies have known security vulnerabilities that are easy to fix:

```powershell
# Stop the container
docker-compose down

# The application needs updated dependencies
# Download the latest version from GitHub (it includes the fixes)
# Or if you're using Git:
git pull

# Rebuild with latest dependencies
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Restart
docker-compose up -d
```

**What this fixes:**
- CVE-2025-62727: DoS vulnerability in Starlette
- CVE-2025-54121: DoS vulnerability in Starlette

### Step 2: Verify Production Configuration

Make sure these settings are correct:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\vibe-quality-searcharr

# Check your configuration
Get-Content .env
```

**Required settings for security:**

Create a `.env` file in your project folder with these settings:

```
# Production mode (REQUIRED)
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Security cookies (REQUIRED)
SECURE_COOKIES=true

# Block local instance URLs unless testing (REQUIRED)
ALLOW_LOCAL_INSTANCES=false

# Single worker mode (REQUIRED for rate limiting)
WORKERS=1

# Your secret keys are already in the secrets/ folder ✅
SECRET_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/secret_key
PEPPER_FILE=/run/secrets/pepper
DATABASE_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/db_key
```

**Apply the changes:**
```powershell
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Enable HTTPS (Recommended)

For secure access, you should use HTTPS. The easiest way on Windows is using Cloudflare Tunnel (free):

**Option A: Cloudflare Tunnel (Easiest for Windows)**

1. Sign up for free Cloudflare account at https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Download cloudflared: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/
3. Run the tunnel:
   ```powershell
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:7337
   ```
4. Follow the link to access your app securely via HTTPS

**Option B: Self-Signed Certificate (Local Network Only)**

If you only access from your local network, you can skip HTTPS for now, but understand this is **less secure**.

### Step 4: Verify Everything is Working Securely

```powershell
# Check the application is running in production mode
docker-compose exec vibe-quality-searcharr env | Select-String "ENVIRONMENT"
# Should show: ENVIRONMENT=production

# Check logs for any errors
docker-compose logs --tail 50
```

### Step 5: Set Up Regular Backups

**Your data is important!** Set up automated backups:

```powershell
# Create a backup folder
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path backups

# Manual backup command (run this weekly)
Copy-Item -Path data\* -Destination backups\backup_$(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd")\ -Recurse
Copy-Item -Path secrets\* -Destination backups\backup_$(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd")\secrets\ -Recurse
```

**Set up automatic backups** using Windows Task Scheduler:

1. Open **Task Scheduler** from Start Menu
2. Create Basic Task → Name it "Vibe Backup"
3. Trigger: Weekly (Sunday at 2 AM)
4. Action: Start a Program
5. Program: `powershell.exe`
6. Arguments:
   ```
   -File "C:\Users\YourName\vibe-quality-searcharr\backup.ps1"
   ```
7. Create `backup.ps1` in your project folder:
   ```powershell
   $date = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"
   $backup = "backups\backup_$date"
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $backup
   Copy-Item -Path data\* -Destination $backup\ -Recurse
   Copy-Item -Path secrets\* -Destination "$backup\secrets\" -Recurse
   Write-Host "Backup completed: $backup"
   ```
