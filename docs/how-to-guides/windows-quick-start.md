5. **Remember this location** - you'll need it in the next steps!

### Option B: Use Git (If you have Git installed)

1. Open **PowerShell** or **Git Bash**
2. Navigate to where you want the files:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\YourName
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/menottim/vibe-quality-searcharr.git
   ```
4. Enter the directory:
   ```powershell
   cd vibe-quality-searcharr
   ```

---

## Generate Security Keys

**Important:** These keys encrypt your data. Never share them!

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project Folder

1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Navigate to where you extracted/cloned the project
3. **Right-click in the folder** (not on a file)
4. Select **"Open in Terminal"** or **"Open PowerShell window here"**
   - If you don't see this option, open PowerShell and use `cd` to navigate:
     ```powershell
     cd "C:\Users\YourName\vibe-quality-searcharr"
     ```

### Step 2: Create the Secrets Folder

Type these commands one at a time, pressing Enter after each:

```powershell
# Create secrets directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path secrets

# Verify it was created
Test-Path secrets
```

You should see `True` after the last command.

### Step 3: Generate Random Keys

**Copy and paste this entire block into PowerShell** (it generates 3 random keys):

```powershell
# Generate database encryption key (32 random bytes, base64-encoded)
$dbKey = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) + (33,35,36,37,38,42,45,46,61,63,64,95) | Get-Random -Count 64 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
$dbKey | Out-File -FilePath "secrets\db_key.txt" -NoNewline -Encoding ASCII

# Generate JWT secret key (32 random bytes, base64-encoded)
$secretKey = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) + (33,35,36,37,38,42,45,46,61,63,64,95) | Get-Random -Count 64 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
$secretKey | Out-File -FilePath "secrets\secret_key.txt" -NoNewline -Encoding ASCII

# Generate password pepper (32 random bytes, base64-encoded)
$pepper = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) + (33,35,36,37,38,42,45,46,61,63,64,95) | Get-Random -Count 64 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
$pepper | Out-File -FilePath "secrets\pepper.txt" -NoNewline -Encoding ASCII

Write-Host "✅ Security keys generated successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "⚠️  IMPORTANT: Never commit the 'secrets' folder to Git!" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

### Step 4: Verify Key Files Were Created

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path secrets
```

You should see three files:
- `db_key.txt`
- `secret_key.txt`
- `pepper.txt`

**⚠️ BACKUP THESE FILES SECURELY!** If you lose them, you cannot decrypt your data.

---

## Start the Application

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

This downloads dependencies and builds the application (takes 5-15 minutes the first time):

```powershell
docker-compose build
```

**What you'll see:**
- Many lines of text scrolling by
- "Building vibe-quality-searcharr"
- Download progress bars
- "Successfully built" at the end

**If you see errors about "no configuration file":**
- Make sure you're in the correct directory (use `pwd` to check)
- The directory should contain `docker-compose.yml`

### Step 2: Start the Container

```powershell
docker-compose up -d
```

**Explanation of flags:**
- `up` = Start the containers
- `-d` = Detached mode (runs in background)

**What you'll see:**
```
Creating network "vibe-quality-searcharr_default" ... done
Creating vibe-quality-searcharr ... done
```

### Step 3: Verify It's Running

```powershell
docker-compose ps
```

You should see:
```
NAME                      STATUS          PORTS
vibe-quality-searcharr    Up 30 seconds   127.0.0.1:7337->7337/tcp
```

The `STATUS` should say "Up" (not "Exited" or "Restarting").

---

## Access the Application

### Step 1: Open Your Browser

1. Open your favorite web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Go to: **http://localhost:7337**

### Step 2: Complete Setup Wizard

You should see a welcome screen! Follow the setup wizard:

   - Enter your Sonarr/Radarr URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8989`)
   - Enter your API key (found in Settings → General in Sonarr/Radarr)
   - Click **"Test Connection"**
   - Click **"Save"**

3. **Start Searching!**
   - Configure your search preferences
   - Create search queues
   - Let the automation begin!

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "docker: command not found"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running (check system tray for whale icon)
2. Restart PowerShell
3. If still failing, reinstall Docker Desktop

### Problem: "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"

**Solution:**
1. Open Docker Desktop from Start Menu
2. Wait for it to fully start (whale icon stops animating)
3. Try the command again

### Problem: "Port 7337 is already in use"

**Solution:**
1. Another program is using port 7337
2. Stop the other program, OR
3. Change the port in `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "127.0.0.1:8080:7337"  # Change 7337 to 8080 (or any available port)
   ```
4. Access at `http://localhost:8080` instead

### Problem: "no configuration file provided: not found"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're in the correct directory:
   ```powershell
   pwd  # Shows current directory
   ```
2. The directory should contain `docker-compose.yml`
3. If not, navigate to the correct directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\YourName\vibe-quality-searcharr"
   ```

### Problem: Container keeps restarting

**Solution:**
1. Check the logs:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose logs
   ```
2. Look for errors (usually missing secret files or configuration issues)
3. Common fixes:
   - Regenerate secret files (see Step 3 above)
   - Check Docker Desktop has enough memory (Settings → Resources → Increase memory to 4GB+)

### Problem: "WSL 2 installation is incomplete"

**Solution:**
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
3. Restart your computer
4. Try starting Docker Desktop again

### Problem: Application is slow

**Solution:**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to Settings → Resources
3. Increase:
   - **CPUs:** At least 2
   - **Memory:** At least 4GB
4. Click **"Apply & Restart"**

## Stopping the Application

To stop the container:

```powershell
docker-compose down
```

To stop and remove all data (⚠️ destructive!):

```powershell
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## Updating the Application

When a new version is released:

```powershell
# Pull latest code (if using Git)
git pull

# Or download new ZIP and extract over old files

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Getting Help

**Still stuck?**

1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshoot.md)
2. Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/menottim/vibe-quality-searcharr/issues)
3. Create a new issue with:
   - Your Windows version
   - Docker Desktop version
   - Full error message
   - Steps you've tried

**Remember:** Include logs but **NEVER** share your secret keys!

```powershell
# Get logs (safe to share)
docker-compose logs > logs.txt
```

---

## Post-Deployment: Critical Security Steps

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Before using the application, complete these security hardening steps!

### Step 1: Update Dependencies (Fix Known CVEs)

Some dependencies have known security vulnerabilities that are easy to fix:

```powershell
# Stop the container
docker-compose down

# The application needs updated dependencies
# Download the latest version from GitHub (it includes the fixes)
# Or if you're using Git:
git pull

# Rebuild with latest dependencies
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Restart
docker-compose up -d
```

**What this fixes:**
- CVE-2025-62727: DoS vulnerability in Starlette
- CVE-2025-54121: DoS vulnerability in Starlette

### Step 2: Verify Production Configuration

Make sure these settings are correct:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\vibe-quality-searcharr

# Check your configuration
Get-Content .env
```

**Required settings for security:**

Create a `.env` file in your project folder with these settings:

```
# Production mode (REQUIRED)
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Security cookies (REQUIRED)
SECURE_COOKIES=true

# Block local instance URLs unless testing (REQUIRED)
ALLOW_LOCAL_INSTANCES=false

# Single worker mode (REQUIRED for rate limiting)
WORKERS=1

# Your secret keys are already in the secrets/ folder ✅
SECRET_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/secret_key
PEPPER_FILE=/run/secrets/pepper
DATABASE_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/db_key
```

**Apply the changes:**
```powershell
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Enable HTTPS (Recommended)

For secure access, you should use HTTPS. The easiest way on Windows is using Cloudflare Tunnel (free):

**Option A: Cloudflare Tunnel (Easiest for Windows)**

1. Sign up for free Cloudflare account at https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Download cloudflared: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/
3. Run the tunnel:
   ```powershell
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:7337
   ```
4. Follow the link to access your app securely via HTTPS

**Option B: Self-Signed Certificate (Local Network Only)**

If you only access from your local network, you can skip HTTPS for now, but understand this is **less secure**.

### Step 4: Verify Everything is Working Securely

```powershell
# Check the application is running in production mode
docker-compose exec vibe-quality-searcharr env | Select-String "ENVIRONMENT"
# Should show: ENVIRONMENT=production

# Check logs for any errors
docker-compose logs --tail 50
```

### Step 5: Set Up Regular Backups

**Your data is important!** Set up automated backups:

```powershell
# Create a backup folder
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path backups

# Manual backup command (run this weekly)
Copy-Item -Path data\* -Destination backups\backup_$(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd")\ -Recurse
Copy-Item -Path secrets\* -Destination backups\backup_$(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd")\secrets\ -Recurse
```

**Set up automatic backups** using Windows Task Scheduler:

1. Open **Task Scheduler** from Start Menu
2. Create Basic Task → Name it "Vibe Backup"
3. Trigger: Weekly (Sunday at 2 AM)
4. Action: Start a Program
5. Program: `powershell.exe`
6. Arguments:
   ```
   -File "C:\Users\YourName\vibe-quality-searcharr\backup.ps1"
   ```
7. Create `backup.ps1` in your project folder:
   ```powershell
   $date = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"
   $backup = "backups\backup_$date"
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $backup
   Copy-Item -Path data\* -Destination $backup\ -Recurse
   Copy-Item -Path secrets\* -Destination "$backup\secrets\" -Recurse
   Write-Host "Backup completed: $backup"
   ```
