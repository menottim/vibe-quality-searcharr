# v0.5.0 Design — UX Overhaul

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** Approved
**Source:** E2E UI testing observations + hand-testing feedback

---

## 1. Setup Wizard: Notifications + Prowlarr Steps

**Flow:** Welcome -> Admin Account -> Instance -> Notifications -> Prowlarr -> Complete

Two new wizard steps inserted between Instance and Complete.

**Step 4: Notifications** (`/setup/notifications`)
- Discord webhook form (URL + test button, auto-saves + tests)
- Skip button prominent: "Skip, I'll set this up later"
- Progress bar updated to show 6 steps

**Step 5: Prowlarr** (`/setup/prowlarr`)
- Prowlarr form (URL, API key, test) with Docker URL hints
- Skip button prominent
- Brief explainer: "Connect Prowlarr for indexer-aware rate limiting"

**Complete page** updated to show which optional steps were configured vs skipped.

## 2. Guided Onboarding Empty States

Each empty-state page shows a numbered workflow tracker that adapts based on current state:

```
1. Add Instance    [done] or [-> Add now]
2. Sync Library    [-> You are here] or [done]
3. Create Queue    [next step]
4. Run Searches    [coming up]
```

Applied to: Library (emphasize step 2), Queues (emphasize step 3), History (emphasize step 4), Exclusions (shown only after library exists).

Workflow state computed server-side from Instance.count(), LibraryItem.count(), SearchQueue.count(), SearchHistory.count() and passed to templates.

## 3. Contextual Dashboard Quick Actions

Replace static 4-link Quick Actions with context-aware card:

- No instances: show only "Add Instance" with emphasis
- Instances but no library: show "Sync Library" as primary
- Library but no queues: show "Create Search Queue" as primary
- Queues exist: show current 4 links (normal state)

Computed from same counts already available in get_dashboard_stats.

## 4. Search History Filter Bar

Inline filter bar above the history table:

- Instance dropdown (populated from user's instances)
- Strategy dropdown (missing, cutoff_unmet, recent)
- Status dropdown (completed, failed, running)
- Date range (start/end date inputs)
- Apply button reloading page with query params

Backend already accepts all these as query params. Template renders filters and passes them through.

Also fix terminology: items_searched -> "Searched", items_found -> "Eligible".

## 5. Login Password Reset Hint

Add muted hint below login form:

```
Forgot your password? Use the CLI:
docker exec splintarr splintarr reset-password <username>
```
